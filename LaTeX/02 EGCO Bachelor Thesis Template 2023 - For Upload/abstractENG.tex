Cryptocurrency is one of the largest investment markets that grows rapidly and it has considerably become one of the biggest digital assets. Many financial institutions and investors try to develop tools that can maximize their profits from the cryptocurrency market. The importance of predicting price trends of cryptocurrency  has raised much attention. Previous research focused on time series analysis and random forests models most of which yield accuracy 54 percent. Multiple evaluation techniques, for example, MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE are used to measure the best prediction models. One of the problems arising in the cryptocurrency market is that the investors/traders could not maximize the profit due to the volatility and could not accurately predict whether the price will increase or not. Since the traders and investors could not accurately predict the price by their own judgment, this project proposes tools that can provide accuracy and precision that can be automated automatically with a risk-management scheme. Every investor will have a different risk level that they are willing to take. By doing so, this project aimed to develop a novel pattern recognition that will help investors to gain profits according to their risk management by using random forest regression. 

Due to unavailability of investors that they could not be on screen 24 hours (problem about monitoring cryptocurrency why not is required). We have developed a semi-automated trading bot that can work 24 hours that will use an API to connect to a cryptocurrency website. Our trading bot will have user-friendly interfaces. It provides an individual risk profile that can do the best trading options according to each user. The trading bot contains cryptocurrency information such as suggesting when to buy and sell points that random forest regression predicted. It also provided demand forecasting whether individual coins are oversold, neutral, or overbought, it will be further used for predicting future price. Most importantly, it will provide prediction of the future price of cryptocurrency of interest.

For the prediction part, we introduced a combination technique of random forest regression, which is Facebook prophet,  and we used mean squared error for evaluation technique`. In addition, we use the results to suggest buy and sell point based technical analysis. Moreover demand forecasting is also collected to measure if the current it is oversold, neutral, or overbuy. The result of our machine learning model accuracy up to 0.9 using r2 evaluation technique.


An abstract should provide a concise summary of your entire thesis. It should report significant elements of your thesis including background or introduction in brief, objectives, statistical data, key finding, and conclusions. Mathematical formulas, diagrams, and other illustrativematerials are not recommended for inclusion. A strong abstract should be self-contained; without abbreviations, footnotes, references. Outside readers typically view the abstract before deciding to read the thesis, so it should be well written, logical, and a complete reflection on you work.
